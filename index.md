This is the course page
for the seminar course
[Sequence and Structure Learning in Computational Linguistics](https://SLiCL2018.github.io)
at the [Department of Linguistics](http://sfs.uni-tuebingen.de),
[University of Tübingen](http://uni-tuebingen.de).

In a typical classification problem, the classes are simple labels
with no internal structure. Some learning problems, however, require
predicting structured outputs. This type of problems are prevalent in
computational linguistics (CL), a typical example being predicting a
parse tree for a given sentence. Sequences are another common type of
structured output that are common in the CL literature.

In this class we will study methods of structured learning, focusing
more on models of sequence learning, and their application in CL. This
is a seminar course where we will read and discuss some classic,
foundational papers, and some new, state-of-the-art papers on the
topic.

## Requirements

This is an advanced seminar for Master's and advanced Bachelor's students.
Prior exposure to machine learning and natural language processing is required.
You can do with basic programming skills if you take the course for
6ECTS (see below), your should also be fluent in programming if you
intend to take the course for 9ECTS.


## Evaluation

The course is worth either 6 or 9 credits, 
depending on the workload.
For 6ECTS, the evaluation will be based on active participation
(Reading, and discussing the papers in the class and online.
This may also include some small programming exercises),
and leading the discussion on one of the papers.
The 9ECTS option has the additional requirement of writing a term paper.
The term paper is ideally based on a practical application of one of
the methods discussed in the class.

We will use GitHub classroom for class discussion and scheduling.
To be able to participate in the class discussion
and access the material, you need to complete a trivial '[assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/l2K1gpoG)'.
This step counts as registration to the course,
please complete it by Monday 5, November 2018.
